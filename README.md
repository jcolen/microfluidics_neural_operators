# Microfluidics and neural operators

Official repository for the manuscript **Interpreting neural operators: how nonlinear waves propagate in non-reciprocal solids** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12918). This contains two folders:

- **neural_networks**: the neural operator and analysis code which generates the SINDy model
- **simulations**: the simulations code comparing the non-reciprocal chain to KdV-Burgers
